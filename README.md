# InternshipProjectTeam42-Recognising-the-specific-activities-from-video
 Now a dayâ€™s recognizing of the activity from the surveillance video is a challenging task. Some activities are not a regular human activity, sometimes it belongs to sports activity or other activities. The sports Activity is the Collection of action /activity e.g. High jump, cricket bowling. There are different types of human activity which are categories in three parts. First, single activity: repeating the same action in the loop. Second, Chain of single Activity: the combination of different Activities of the first type and Third, Activity interaction with object or person. Here focused on the second type of activity mostly found in sports and highlight these activities present video.
 
 In the process of human activity recognition, there are many computer vision techniques to detect it. Many hybrid techniques are using two different techniques to identify the activity like applying image processing and machine learning techniques together. Apply the suitable technique of deep learning to fulfill the task like CNN, RNN, LSTM and the combination of this to achieve the goal.

# Input / Data set:  Sports Video dataset , UCF101dataset  

# Expected Output: Find and Labelled the Sub-Activity Present in Video 


Example:
1.	High Jump  : 
 Sub Activity: Running, Jumping on a horizontal pole
2.	Long JUMP: 
 Sub Activity: Running and Long Jump
3.	Cricket Bowling :
